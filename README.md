# Introduction

This project is a prototype for the purpose demonstrairing how to use [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) as an IAM (Identity and Access Management) provider.

## System Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [docker-compose](https://github.com/docker/compose)

## Setting up the project

The process for installing and getting up and running the project is fully automated by the `./manage` script and the varios commands it provides.

### Before you start

You have to modify your `/etc/hosts` file and append the following:

```bash
127.0.0.1 amadita.loc
127.0.0.1 konga.amadita.loc
127.0.0.1 accounts.amadita.loc
```

<span style="color:red">
  NOTE: If you are using mac you maybe need to replace `127.0.0.1` with the docker virtual machine IP address.
</span>

### Installing

`./manage install`

This command will:

- Download images, if not present.
- Build images from Dockerfiles, if needed.
- Run containers.
- Run database migrations and setup scripts.
- Get the system up and running.

<span style="color:red">
  NOTE: This command must only be used the first time you run the system, or after executing `./manage uninstall`.
</span>

After the scripts are done executing you can access the application through your browser:

- [https://amadita.loc:8443](https://amadita.loc:8443): Dummy react application created with react-create-app.
- [https://konga.amadita.loc:8443](https://konga.amadita.loc:8443): Kong dashboard.
- [https://accounts.amadita.loc:8443](https://accounts.amadita.loc:8443): Keycloak dashboard.

### Running

`./manage init`

This command will init the system after it have been halted.

### Configuring keycloak and kong

`./manage bootstrap`

This command will:

- Set up the the realm in Keycloak.
- Register services in kong.

### Stopping

`./manage halt`

This command will shutdown the system.

### Uninstalling

`./manage uninstall`

This command will:

- Stop containers.
- Remove containers.
- Remove volumes.
- Remove networks.
- Remove built images.

### Executing docker-compose commands

Any docker-docker compose command can be executed by following this syntax `./manage [docker-compose comand]`, e.g.:

```bash
./manage logs -f kong
./manage exec kong bash
./manage restart keycloak
```

## Setting up Azure AD

### Requirements
- The system must be up and running.
- An Azure account with access to Azure AD.

### Setup

#### Setting Keycloak

1. Ragister a new application using Azure portal; follow the instructions in this [link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app).

2. Let's import the configuration. Copy the OpenID connect metadata url.
